This folder exists to unclutter the root of the repository 
from files that are arguably obsolete.

Despite being obsolete, we decided to preserve them because we tend to
annotate these kind of files with comments and rationales.

Furthermore, we decided against deleting them and "still have them in the
git history" because:
1. Out of sight, out of mind.
1. We haven't even learned yet how to search the git history
1. Knowing Git, the search process is probably some convoluted invocation of 
magic words in the terminal that will return unscrutable results unless you
copy-paste an even more convoluted incantation you found on Stack Overflow
that will give you decent-looking results. And I don't want to spend 2~3 hours
to learn something that will fustrate me every time I'm going to use it.
