    /* IMPORTANT VOCABULARY

    # Run Length Encoding (RLE) #
    | Symbol         | Meaning                                                                |
    |----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Scanline       | A row of pixels                                                        |
    | Segment        | A run of consecutive pixels of the same colour on the same scanline(1) |
    | Index          | An index where the first item in the list is at index 0                |
    | Start (In RLE) | Index                 of the first pixel in this segment               |
    | End   (In RLE) | Index AFTER the index of the last  pixel in this segment(2)            |

    (1): I know that the technical term for this is a "run", as it is the "run" in "run length encoding",
         but I feel that "run" is too close to "row", and the goal of establishing this vocabulary is
         to have words for different things that: 1) *are* different, and that 2) **look** different.

    **************************************************************************************
    ******** MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION IN THIS WHOLE COMMENT ****************************

    (2): It is crucial to remember that the "End" of a segment is *not* `last index`,
         but `last index + 1`. It is how we can identify segments on different scanlines 
         that don't overlap, but are diagonally adjacent.

    # Positionality #
    |     |    Left |    Cent |    Righ |
    |-----|---------|---------|---------|
    | Top | TopLeft | TopCent | TopRigh |
    | Mid | MidLeft | MidCent | MidRigh |
    | Bot | BotLeft | BotCent | BotRigh |

        ## A note about "This" and "Next" ##
        It is rarely (never?) important to know if the next row of data in a Power Query table
        is actually to the top or to the bottom of the previous row. Also, depending on how a
        bitmap has been stored in its file, the next row could be either top or bottom.

        This is why we used "This" and "Next" in several names, because what's important is that
        we're comparing "this" row with the "next" row, wether that's top or bottom, or right or left.

        However, while coding and choosing the variable and column names, we realized that positional
        terminology was necessary to tell us quickly what the variable was intended to be.

        For example, when finding the diagonal neighbours. We want TopLeft and TopRigh. But how do we name
        those with "This" and "Next"? DiagThisStartNextEnd?? (TopLeft) And then DiagThisEndNextStart??? (TopRigh)
        DiagThisStartNextEnd and DiagThisEndNextStart look to me like undistinguishable gibberish at first glance,
        and just gibberish at second glance.

        Also, if you're getting confused as to why some places use This/Next and others use positionality,
        it's not you, it's me who never managed to establish a consistent convention for which situation deserves which term.
        Towards the end of this implementation, I spent a good amount of time renaming variables and columns 
        to use terminology in ways that at least *feel* consistent, but... yeah :|



    # Relations & Adjacencies #
    | Symbol              | Meaning                            |
    |---------------------|------------------------------------|
    | A                   | The colour "A"                     |
    | {B,A}               | "Colour B is adjacent to colour A" |
    | An adjacency        | {B,A}                              |
    | Two adjacencies     | {B,A}, {C,D}                       |
    | Two adjacencies     | {A,B}, {B,A}                       |
    | A relation          | { {A,B}, {B,A} }                   |
    | An ordered relation | {A,B}                              |

    Since {A,B} always imply that {B,A} is also true, we can (and do!) 
        remove {B,A} from intermediary datasets to improve performances.

    /* How the top neighbours are computed:
    TopLeft, TopCent, and TopRigh are in the same section of the code because of how similar they are to compute.
    TopLeft and TopRigh may be ignored if the DontRelateDiagonals option is set to True.

    For performance, computations are done with merge-sort joins, and most notably a 
        full outer merge-sort join for TopCent.
    The joins are performed between pairs of consecutive scanlines.
    For example, say we have these two (unencoded) scanlines of pixels:
        (Col Index)  : 0       4       8 9
        Next Scanline: E E E E F F F F G
        This Scanline: A A B B B B C C D
        (Col Index)  : 0   2       6   8 9
    After the Run Length Encoding, we can get these 2 subtables(*):
        [This Scanline]                         ~   [Next Scanline]
        [This.Colour] [This.Start] [This.End]   ~   [Next.Colour] [Next.Start] [Next.End]
        A             0            2            ~   E             0            4
        B             2            6            ~   F             4            8
        C             6            8            ~   G             8            9
        D             8            9            ~
        
        (*): A "subtable" is a Power Query table contained within a cell of another Power Query table.
             So for the two subtables above, the "table" has the two columns [This Scanline] and [Next Scanline].
             Then, the two shown subtables are contained in the cells of the first row of the "table".
             The representation in this comment is a bit funky because I tried to only show what's relevant.

    For the diagonal neighbours, (TopLeft and TopRigh), look at the last 2 columns in the example:
        (Col Index)  :      8 9
        Next Scanline:    F G
        This Scanline:    C D
        (Col Index)  :      8 9
    We can see that...
        For D, TopLeft is F
        For C, TopRigh is G
    We can find all the TopLeft neighbours by joining with This.Start and Next.End
        For D, This.Start is 8. For F, Next.End   is also 8.
    We can find all the TopRigh neighbours by joining with This.End   and Next.Start
        For C, This.End   is 8. For G, Next.Start is also 8.

    For the TopCent neighbours, a full outer merge-sort join on This.Start and Next.Start,
        followed by a fill-down, will find all segments that overlap.
    The join:
        [This.Colour] [This.Start] [This.End] [Next.Colour] [Next.Start] [Next.End]
        A             0            2          E             0            4
        B             2            6          null          null         null
        null          null         null       F             4            8
        C             6            8          null          null         null
        D             8            9          G             8            9   
    The fill-down:
        [This.Colour] [This.Start] [This.End] [Next.Colour] [Next.Start] [Next.End]
        A             0            2          E             0            4
        B             2            6          E             0            4
        B             2            6          F             4            8
        C             6            8          F             4            8
        D             8            9          G             8            9    
    Just the colour columns (others were removed):     
        [This.Colour] [Next.Colour]
        A             E
        B             E
        B             F
        C             F
        D             G
